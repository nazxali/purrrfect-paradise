Please contact us directly to discuss your requirements. You can email us including details of length of time, number of cats and type of event, to help us pick the best cover for your rental period.Alternatively, you may call or write to us! Please note, we do not cater for events where loud music is continously playing as we have a duty of care to our feline friends. We've all seen what happens when you turn a vacuum cleaner on near a cat!! Disclaimer: please do not attempt this at home, you will cause distress to your buddy!
